## Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è

**THIS IS THE VERSION OF THE PROJECT FROM DECEMBER 2022 !!!**

This project was written as part of an internship in December 2022. The development took place according to the terms of reference that the teacher gave me.
I successfully passed this project as the best project among all groups. Despite this, I am going to finalize this project, rewrite some parts of the code, improve user interaction with the interface. As soon as I finish writing my graduation project, I will definitely finalize this one.

**Thank you for your attention üç™**
